# flask-dashboard
a flask dashboard with chart.js to visualize the data from excel

for the latest commit - render deployment 
- currently uisng ngrok to deploy the flask app
- render is not appropriate as the excel file need to be at bitbucket (to be updated from time to time)
- so, the requirement.txt file is not usable since render is not use.
